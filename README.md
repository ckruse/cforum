[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ckruse/cforum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ckruse/cforum)

The Classic Forum is a modern and flexible threaded forum software
written in Ruby on Rails. It uses PostgreSQL as its backend.

It tries to give the user an alternative to all questionable design-
or function decisions and thus aims to be highly configurable without
losing performance.

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL 9.3 or newer
- Ruby 2 or newer
- Rails 4.2

## Installations

- [SELFHTML Forum](http://forum.selfhtml.org/)
